**Module Title**: Control Systems Analysis and Design | **Location**: London, UK | **Dates**: Feb 2023 - Apr 2023

This project, conducted for the EMS507 module, involved a control experiment on managing water levels in a tank using both open and closed-loop systems. The focus was on designing and tuning a PID controller to optimise system response, enhancing stability and reducing response time.

### Project Overview:
- **Control Theory**: The experiment utilised control theory principles to assess the performance of open and closed-loop systems, specifically in terms of rise time, settling time, and stability. Closed-loop feedback was incorporated through PID control to actively regulate water levels based on real-time data.
  
- **PID Controller Design**: Using MATLAB, the PID controller was initially designed and tuned, with adjustments made based on experimental results.

- **Procedure**: The open-loop experiment provided insights into the systemâ€™s time constant, while the closed-loop experiment highlighted the response of the system with various PID settings.

### Learning Outcomes:
This project enhanced my practical skills in control theory, particularly in the design, tuning, and analysis of PID controllers for closed-loop systems.

**Key Skills**: Control Systems, PID Tuning, MATLAB Simulation, Experimental Analysis.
