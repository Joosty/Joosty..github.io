This project was part of the ESA Space Debris Training Course held at ESEC Galaxia, Belgium, in September 2024. I worked as part of a multidisciplinary, multinational team to design and assess a mission plan for the Sentinel 2c satellite, aligning our efforts with ESA’s space debris mitigation guidelines and supporting a zero debris approach.

Key components of my work include:

- **Mission Planning**: Collaborated with team members to develop a comprehensive mission plan covering spacecraft operations, disposal strategies, and risk assessments.
- **Satellite Modelling**: Utilized ESA Drama for satellite modelling, lifetime estimation, collision risk assessment, impact risk analysis, avoidance maneuvers, and ground risk simulations.
- **Proposal Presentation**: Created and presented our mission proposal to the head of the ESA space debris office and space debris engineers, emphasizing our findings and recommendations.

### Technical Skills
- ESA Drama
- ESA Master
- Mission Planning
- Risk Assessment
- Guideline Adherence
- Technical Documentation

### Soft Skills
- Time Management
- Teamwork
- Attention to Detail
- Leadership

This experience enhanced my understanding of space debris management and equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute to sustainable space operations.
