This project involves the development of two specialized textbooks focusing on dynamics in the fields of Computational Spacecraft and Symbolic Dynamics, supervised by Dr. Angadh Nanjangud. The aim is to provide students and professionals with in-depth resources that bridge theoretical concepts and practical applications in aerospace engineering.

Key components of my work include:

- **Content Creation**: Collaborating with subject matter experts to curate and refine material, ensuring clarity and educational value.
- **Simulation Examples**: Developing practical exercises that utilize real-world scenarios, enhancing understanding of complex dynamics.
- **Research Integration**: Including cutting-edge research findings to provide students with current and relevant knowledge in the field.

This effort aims to support academic growth and foster a deeper understanding of dynamics in aerospace contexts, ultimately preparing the next generation of engineers for the challenges of the industry.
