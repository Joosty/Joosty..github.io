**Module Title**: EMS610 Spacecraft Design: Manoeuvring and Orbital Mechanics | **Location**: London, UK | **Dates**: Current

This project involves the design and planning of the Comet Interceptor mission as part of the EMS610 coursework. The goal is to develop a spacecraft capable of launching into a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point, waiting for a comet target, and subsequently executing an interplanetary transfer to rendezvous with the comet.

### Project Overview:
- **Mission Concept**: The Comet Interceptor will be launched as a secondary payload on an M-class mission, scheduled for 2028. Its unique design allows for operation without a predetermined target comet, capitalising on advancements in sky survey technologies that enable early detection of incoming comets.

- **Orbit and Transfers**: Using the Patched Conic Method, the coursework involves calculating the ∆V requirements for two primary manoeuvres:
  1. **Transfer to L2**: Estimating the ΔV needed to transfer the spacecraft from its parking orbit in the Earth’s equatorial plane to a halo orbit around the L2 point.
  2. **Cruise to Target Comet**: Once a comet is identified, determining the ΔV necessary to intercept the comet, bringing the spacecraft within 500 km of its surface.

- **Fuel Efficiency**: The design takes advantage of the stable gravitational balance at the L2 point, minimising fuel usage for both station-keeping and trajectory adjustments when approaching the comet.
