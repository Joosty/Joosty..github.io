This project was part of the ESA Space Debris Training Course held at ESEC Galaxia, Belgium, in September 2024. I worked as part of a multidisciplinary, multinational team to design and assess a mission plan for the disposal of the Sentinel 2c satellite, aligning our efforts with ESAâ€™s space debris mitigation guidelines and supporting a zero debris approach.

Key components of my work include:

- **Mission Planning**: Collaborated with team members to develop a comprehensive mission plan covering spacecraft operations, disposal strategies, and risk assessments.
- **Satellite Modelling**: Utilized ESA Drama for satellite modelling, lifetime estimation, collision risk assessment, impact risk analysis, avoidance manoeuvres, and ground risk simulations.
- **Proposal Presentation**: Created and presented our mission proposal to the head of the ESA space debris office and space debris engineers, emphasizing our findings and recommendations.

This experience was supported by lectures from experts at ESEC throughout the week, providing me with insights into the risks, guidelines, and technology surrounding debris and end-of-life satellites. It enhanced my understanding of space debris management and equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute to sustainable space operations.
