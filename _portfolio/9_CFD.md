**Module Title**: Simulation Tools in Engineering Analysis and Design | **Location**: London, UK | **Dates**: Sep 2023 - Dec 2023

This project, part of the EMS602U module, explores how mesh refinement and order of accuracy influence the simulation of inviscid flow over a two-dimensional profile of a compressor stator blade. STAR CCM+ was employed for this CFD study, with results focused on identifying the optimal mesh and accuracy order for predicting static and total pressure coefficients, as well as force coefficients.

### Project Overview:
- **Simulation Model**: This simulation modeled a single compressor stator blade profile, utilizing the symmetry of blade placement in the compressor. The two-dimensional approach allowed for efficient extrapolation to the full compressor design.

- **Mesh Refinement and Accuracy**: Various mesh refinements and accuracy orders were tested, with results indicating that a fine, second-order mesh provided the closest match to theoretical pressure and force coefficients. The refined mesh produced smoother, more stable simulations with lower error margins.

- **Optimization Findings**: The study highlighted that localized mesh refinement could yield similarly accurate results with lower computational demands, optimizing the simulation's efficiency.
