**Module Title**: Computational Engnieering | **Location**: London, UK | **Dates**: Oct 2024 - Current

This project, part of the EMS724 module, investigates the static performance of a 3D frame structure used in ESA’s BEXUS high-altitude balloon missions. Through ABAQUS modeling and analysis, the frame design was refined to withstand the stresses encountered at altitudes up to 30 km over multi-hour flights.

### Project Overview:
- **Structure and Model**: The study focuses on a 45x45mm frame section from the ESCARGO gondola. The 3D model in ABAQUS captures the frame’s essential features to simulate realistic stress conditions.
  
- **Mesh Convergence**: A mesh convergence study was conducted to ensure accuracy while optimizing computational resources. This refinement process balanced element size with solution precision.
  
- **Design Revisions**: After achieving convergence, structural modifications were tested in ABAQUS to examine their impact on stress distribution and overall performance.
