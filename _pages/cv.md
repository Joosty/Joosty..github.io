## Personal Profile

A Queen Mary University of London undergraduate student pursuing an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. Dedicated to spacecraft and debris modelling, with a strong foundation in spacecraft dynamics, mission planning, and design. Academic coursework and projects have equipped me with proficiency in orbital mechanics, dynamics modelling of spacecraft systems, and risk analysis. Proven professional adaptability and communication skills from experience in the civil sector, adhering to guidelines on large-scale, high-pressure projects. My upcoming MEng project is titled 'Design and Implementation of a Digital Twin for a CubeSat'. Actively seeking graduate opportunities, focusing on engineering or research roles in satellite operations, dynamics, and modelling.
