I am a final-year MEng Aerospace Engineering student at Queen Mary University of London, graduating in 2025, with experience in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using MATLAB/SIMULINK, rigid body dynamics with Python, and finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using Abaqus and Star CCM+. Currently, I am designing an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) for a CubeSat digital twin, integrating sensors and control algorithms while also developing a Python-based orbital decay simulation for mission planning. My civil engineering background has strengthened my skills in requirements management and effective communication, and I am eager to contribute to the design and implementation of advanced systems in aerospace and defence.


**I am currently:**
- Working on two online textbooks for use in QMUL's teaching, [Symbolic Computational Dynamics](https://github.com/angadhn/ComputationalDynamics) and [Computational Spacecraft Dynamics](https://github.com/angadhn/SpacecraftDynamics), as an active contributor and reviewer.
- Working as part of a team, under Dr. Reanjan Vepa, to design and implement a generic digital twin for a previously designed CubeSat. Specifically, I am designing and integrating the attitude determination and control system within MATLAB/SIMULINK.
- Working as the lead mechanical engineer as part of an international team, under both academic and industry support, to propose an experiment to the [ESA REXUS/BEXUS Program](https://rexusbexus.net/) focused on Space Object Brightness Evaluation and Reference (S.O.B.E.R).
- Working within the QMSEDS satellite design team, focusing on both the hardware and software, design and integration for a CubeSat attitude and orbital control system (AOCS).
