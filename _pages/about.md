I am Joost Hubbard, an MEng Aerospace Engineering student at Queen Mary University of London. My passion lies in aerodynamics, propulsion systems, and spacecraft design. I have gained practical and theoretical  experience through internships and academia, where I developed skills in CAD, FEM, CFD, and mission planning software as well as hands-on engineering tasks. I thrive in team environments and enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges. Outside of academics, I am an avid cook and a dedicated follower of Formula One. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for aerospace engineering in future opportunities.
