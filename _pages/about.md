I am Joost Hubbard, an MEng Aerospace Engineering student at Queen Mary University of London. My passion lies in orbital mechanics, propulsion systems, and spacecraft design. I have gained practical and theoretical  experience through internships and academia, where I developed skills in CAD, FEM, CFD, and mission planning software as well as hands-on engineering tasks. I thrive in team environments and enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges. Outside of academics, I am an avid cook, hiker and a dedicated follower of Formula One. I am open to any opportunities in the engineering sphere, mainly looking to develop into a future career in the space sector.


**I am currently:**
- Working on two online textbooks for use in QMUL's teaching, [Symbolic Computational Dynamics](https://github.com/angadhn/ComputationalDynamics) and [Computational Spacecraft Dynamics](https://github.com/angadhn/SpacecraftDynamics), as an active contributor and reviewer.
- Developing background knowledge required for variable mass systems simulation and research.
- Preparing for my visit to ESA Galaxia as part of [ESA Academy's Space Debris Training Course 2024](https://www.esa.int/Education/ESA_Academy/Space_Debris_Training_Course_2024_open_for_applications).
