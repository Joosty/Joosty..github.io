Over the summer in addition to personal research, I have been working as an active contributor to both a spacecraft dynamics textbook and a computational dynamics textbook created using Jupyter Books to complement modules taught at the Queen Mary University of London. As our project continues to evolve, we've recognized the need for a streamlined process to build and preview Jupyter Books locally on Windows machines. This capability is crucial for our team members to review their contributions before submitting pull requests on GitHub. To address this need, I've developed a comprehensive tutorial that walks through the process step-by-step.

## Why This Tutorial?

While the Jupyter Book documentation is extensive, it can sometimes be overwhelming for newcomers, especially those working on Windows systems. Our tutorial aims to provide a concise, Windows-specific guide that allows contributors to quickly set up their environment and start building books locally.

## Key Features of the Tutorial

1. **Prerequisites**: Clear instructions on setting up Python and Pip on Windows, including troubleshooting steps for common PATH issues.
2. **Step-by-Step Guide**: A detailed walkthrough of the book creation process, from installation to building.
3. **Windows-Specific**: Tailored for Windows users, addressing platform-specific nuances.
4. **Practical Examples**: Uses a sample book to demonstrate the process, making it easy for users to follow along.

## Looking Ahead

This tutorial is just the beginning. As we continue to work with Jupyter Books, we may discover more efficient workflows or encounter new challenges!

For those interested in diving deeper into Jupyter Book capabilities, I recommend exploring the [official Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/). Our tutorial serves as a quick-start guide, but the full documentation offers insights into more advanced features and customizations.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving the tutorial, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can contact me directly at j.hubbard@se21.qmul.ac.uk.

Happy book building!
