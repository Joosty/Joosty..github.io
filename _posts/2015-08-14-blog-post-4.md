This is just a test blog post for getting used to using this new site and git in general. This site is based on the <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io" target="_blank">academic pages student template</a>. 

<h1>Whats next?</h1>

I'm hoping to use this website to maintain a record of my projects as well as any other ideas that I might want to blog about - whether this be space news or anything else I'm interested in.
