On and off over the past few months I've been reading 'What if?' by Randall Monroe. Since the book is so popular it feels almost pointless to explain it, but I will just in case. The premise centres around providing logical, scientific solutions to absurd questions, think things like: 'What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light?'. These topics are covered in a way to keep the reader engaged, using humour while still actually answering the question somewhat accurately.  

I like the book. You should too. Go read it.
