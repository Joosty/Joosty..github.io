Building upon my prior work using the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations to create a trajectory simulation for a target and chaser satellite (as discussed in blog post 2), the next step was to utilize and develop this code to compare the effects of impulsive and non-impulsive manoeuvres modelling. This somewhat spiralled into me writing a short paper to summarise my work (still in progress but attached to this post nonetheless).

When simulating satellite manoeuvres, the tracking of the satellite's resultant trajectory can be computed in a multitude of ways; the most prominent manners of modelling are impulsive and non-impulse models. An impulsive model assumes that a satellite undergoes an instantaneous velocity change where the position vector remains stationary at the burn point[^1] but it can be close enough when approximating a high thrust, short burn. A non-impulsive manoeuvre (or extended burn) is a burn that does occur over a time period and as such is much more realistic. They can typically be used to represent low-thrust, extended burns.

Running these simulations allowed me to model two manoeuvres with the same magnitude of force applied - one instantaneously and one across an extended period - highlighting the disparities in trajectory between the two[^2]. Nice pictures of this stuff is attached to this post :).
